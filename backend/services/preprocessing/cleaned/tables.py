"""The registry of the cleaned layer: one entry per file in data/cleaned, declaring its key, its foreign keys, its provenance and
where it lands in SAP HANA Cloud.

The build, the integrity checks, the tests and the readiness report all read this, so a file's key or mapping is written down once.
`hana_table` names the table of the PROPOSED HANA schema (the one in the data-audit report); nothing is created in HANA. A `hana_notes`
entry says where the file differs from that proposal, because the proposal was drafted before the data was cleaned and a few of its
columns did not survive contact with the data.

Load tiers:
    CORE       load these; the application and the agents need them
    OPTIONAL   ready and correct, but large or redundant: load only if you want the extra lineage
    NOT_LOADED clean and usable, but recommended to stay in the file / AI layer
