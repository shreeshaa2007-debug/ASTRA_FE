"""Shared World State schemas — architecture.md §5, brief §14.

One WorldState per simulation_id. Every agent reads it; only the orchestrator
writes it, and only through named checkpoints (backend/services/world_state).
Field names follow §14 exactly; the extras (status, version, replan_count,
approval_decision, error) are what the checkpoint machinery needs to enforce
the human-approval gate and the bounded replan.
